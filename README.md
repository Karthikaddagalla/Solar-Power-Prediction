# Power Prediction from Solar System
This project uses Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to predict the power generated from solar panels based on temperature and irradiance.

## Getting Started
To get started, you will need to install the following dependencies:

* Python 3.7+
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the code by following these steps:

1) Clone the repository.
2) Open the **Final_code_file_10_seconds.ipynb** file.
3) Run the code.

You can use any of the above files based on the time interval. Here time interval represents the time gap between the each data point when collected from the solar system.

## Models
This code contains 11 models to predict the power generated from solar panels:

1) Radial basis Neural Network
2) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network
3) Modular Neural Network
4) Multiple Linear Regression
5) Support Vector Machine Regressor
6) Decision Tree Regressor
7) Random Forest Regressor
8) Quantile Linear Regressor
9) Orthogonal Linear Regressor
10) Ridge Regressor
11) Kernel ridge Regressor

Out of all the models, Radial basis Neural Network performed best with a RMSE(Root Mean Square Error) of 19.118 in the 10 seconds interval
