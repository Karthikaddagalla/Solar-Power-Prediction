# Solar Panel Power Prediction
This project uses Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to predict the power generated from solar panels based on temperature and irradiance.

## Getting Started
To get started, you will need to install the following dependencies:

* Python 3.8+
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the code by following these steps:

Clone the repository.
Open the solar_panel_power_prediction.py file.
Change the DATA_DIR variable to the path of the directory containing the data files.
Run the code.
