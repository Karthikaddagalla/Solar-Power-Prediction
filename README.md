# Power Prediction from Solar System
This project uses Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to predict the power generated from solar panels based on temperature and irradiance.

## Getting Started
To get started, you will need to install the following dependencies:

* Python 3.7+
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the code by following these steps:

1) Clone the repository.
2) Open the Final_code_file_10_seconds.ipynb file.
3) Run the code.

You can use any of the above files based on the time interval. Here time interval represents the time gap between the each data point when collected from the solar system.

## Models
The code contains 11 models to predict the power generated from solar panels:

1) Radial basis Neural Networks
2) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks
3) Modular Neural Networks
4) Multiple Linear Regression
5) Support Vector Machine Regressor
6) Decision Tree Regressor
7) Random Forest Regressor
8) Quantile Linear Regressor
9) Orthogonal Linear Regressor
10) Ridge Regressor
11) Kernel ridge Regressor
